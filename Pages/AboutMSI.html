            <h2>Mughal Shabbir Industries' journey of hard work, achievements, farmers' trust and value addition.</h2> <br>
            <p>Our services for the farmers began in 1984. In an agricultural county like Pakistan, it was the time when there was a great bump of agricultural produce and a great laps of time in the field to harvest the crop. The farmers had to suffer the loss of precious sunny days and often when due to crop not cut in time and it rained--the farmer had to bear the enormous loss of his season's produce. And that was the time when Mughal Shabbir Industries stepped out in the market.</p> <br>
            <p>The times when the farmer had the option of either to bear a heavy labour cost for harvesting his crop in time, or to be on the edge of suffering his crop rained over, Mughal Shabbir Industries emerged out as a perl in the shell. We provided the farmers the quality solutions in our vast range of products which suited the needs of farmers the in the ways they desired. </p>
